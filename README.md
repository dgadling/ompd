Around 2009/2010 I somehow found @danpaluska (https://www.youtube.com/danpaluska) doing blurry timelapses of his work computer during the day.
I liked this quite a bit but the shell script was horrible, so I started making my own.
Over years the shell scripts grew in complexity and reliability and such, and got to working pretty well.
Everything about it was 100% MacOS specific.

Then I wanted to have this for Windows as well.

Problems.

Since I wanted to learn Rust as well though, there was an obvious solution! Here we are.
